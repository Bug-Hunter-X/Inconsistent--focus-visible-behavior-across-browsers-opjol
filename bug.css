The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual issue where the expected behavior of the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class is not consistently observed across different browsers.

```css
.button {
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 10px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.button:focus-visible {
  background-color: lightgreen;
  outline: none;
  box-shadow: 0 0 5px rgba(0, 128, 0, 0.5);
}
```

This code should change the background color and add a box-shadow to the button element when it receives focus, but only if the focus is programmatically triggered or otherwise not the result of a default browser action (like tabbing through elements).  However, inconsistent behavior might arise due to browser differences in focus-visible implementation and handling of custom styles or the presence of other scripts or CSS rules affecting focus.
